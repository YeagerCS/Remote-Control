All Ips get pulled from the start:

- Check if flask server is accessible with IP instead of localhost
- Add all pulled ips in an array
- Display all pulled ips on a start page
- Select ips for the current device
- Replace websocket host with selected ip
- Remove device identifier

- (Does this work with public ips?)
